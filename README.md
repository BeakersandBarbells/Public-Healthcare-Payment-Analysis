# Public-Healthcare-Payment-Analysis

This analysis set out to better understand the price variance of healthcare within the US.

The data was pulled from public sources on Medicare and Medicaid and contains data from every medical claim to Medicare and Medicaid, coded by DRG, from 2014.

My analysis focused mainly on the variance in price between procedures with the next step of analysis focusing on the variance in price between hospitals.

If there are any questions or clarifications needed for the code or thought process you can email me at beakersandbarbells@gmail.com
