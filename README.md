# Public-Healthcare-Payment-Analysis

This analysis set out to better understand the price variance of healthcare within the US. This is a core problem in the United States as often deals are struck between hospitals and the various insurance companies to ensure a constant state of pseudo-discounts for many procedures.

The data was pulled from the centers for Medicare and Medicaid services government data site (https://data.cms.gov/) and contains data from every medical claim to Medicare and Medicaid, coded by DRG, from 2014.

My analysis focused mainly on the variance in price between procedures. The results of that analysis can be seen in my figures section. I hope the next step of analysis focuses on the variance in price between hospitals.

If there are any questions or clarifications needed for the code or thought process you can email me at beakersandbarbells@gmail.com!

Thanks for reading!
